- Wednesday 12/14: Round-table/lightning talk presentation and debrief of final projects and course.



## Final presentation expectations

- Roundtable checkin with the following questions:
  - What did you set out to do?
  - How did you approach it?
  - What did you find?
      - What were your results?
      - OR What were the (unexpected) obstacles you encountered?
  - What would be your next questions based on the work you ahve done so far?
  - What would you like to take away/remember most about the final project experience?

## Final writeup expectations

- Create an .Rmd or .md in your final-project repo with your final writeup.
- Think of it as notes for a future you or future collaborator who wants to remember how this line of work went and how they could pick it up in future.
- Here are some questions to help structure your writeup if you do not have something already in mind. (If you already have something written or well on its way, no need to reorganize it! However, if you aren't sure where to start, start here!):
  - What was your question?
  - How did you try to approach it?
  - What did you find? OR, what obstacles did you encounter?
  - What do you think are the next steps?
  - What would be your words of wisdom to someone trying to continue this work?
